      "originalDescription": "In the 1066 game you get to control the English, Viking or Norman armies. The aim of the game is to defeat your enemy's army by killing or scaring off as many of them as possible! The game puts you into the thick of the action, giving you direct control over every arrow barrage, cavalry charge and defensive stand. Taunts, chants and the presence of a strong leader will all prove crucial to winning the day.\n\nA multiplayer option also offers the chance to test your mettle against friends.\n\nUpdates:\nIf the game is running slowly for you, try right clicking and changing the quality to 'medium' or 'low'. This should help improve performance.\n\nInstructions:\nFor full instructions, click on the 'How to Play' section of the game.\n-\nMoving and Attacking the Enemy\nSelecting the 'Move' command allows you to select a new position for your unit. The highlighted area indicates your unit's range of movement. Different units can move different distances.\n-\nThe Battle Unfolds\nOnce you have selected your commands, hit the 'EXECUTE COMMANDS' button and all the actions are played out in the Battle View. You will need to keep your wits about you, as you will be thrown into different mini-games which will determine the outcome of the round.\n-\nArchery\nClick and drag your mouse on the battlefield to select the power and angle of your archer attack - then let go to rain arrow down on your enemy.\n-\nCombat\nWhen two opposing units are next to each other, combat will occur. Hit the cursor keys at the right time to inflict brutal damage on your enemy.\n-\nTaunt\nType the insult as quickly as possible to rally your troops and scare your enemy into submission.\n-\nCharge\nWhen a unit is charging tap the space-bar as quickly as possible to build up power and smash through your enemy.\n-\nMorale\nThe morale of your army is incredibly important in the game, so keep a close eye on the ARMY MORALE in the info panel. Keeping your morale high and reducing that of your enemy will be the key to victory.",

Complete your conquest of the orcs by destroying them in 12 action packed levels and three difficulty settings. Can you beat your panic in Battle Panic?",

Now it is a race against time to bring the Thorned Emerald back to its proper home before Cactus McCoy is turned to a lifeless stone cactus.\n\nThis platforming brawler game will have you wielding tons of weapons as you traverse a strange Wild West world of hidden treasures and seemingly endless enemigos. Can you become the toughest Cactus in town, and break the ancient Curse of Thorns?",

This is a stick sniper masterpiece where you take on the role of an assassin who has lead a hard life full of cold blood and hot women. It's a dark world when you're an assassin for hire and even though he may be the best there is at what he does, that doesn't mean what he does is very nice! Use basic sniper mechanics to delve into the questionable past of this hitman as you rack up a kill count and blast your way through his story. This is a story based stick sniper shooter which brings the duo-tone world of hyper-violent stick games to life through its deep characterization, and complex storytelling. You'll be introduced to characters you might not like but you will definitely understand. You will be forced to question your own morals and ethics as you stare down the barrel of a gun and into the yawning chasm of imperfect humans. Stick games are a staple of the casual gaming industry. They have been around longer than any of us and will probably be around a lot longer than any of us. Clear Vision is a step above the rest. It is truly one of the greatest stick sniper games available.",

This has been a dream of mine since I joined NG 4 years ago* *Also, at this rate I can't comment on every review, I do read all of them though and every bit of feedback is appreciated!* D-Day: June 6, 1944, 6:30 am. 160,000 allied infantry troops are approaching the coasts of Normandy to conduct the largest amphibious landing in history. There you are, a lone soldier in a turret. How long can you hold them off? Note: D-Day Defender is not beatable. History will have its course, and the Allied Invasion will succeed. But how long will you endure? INSTRUCTIONS Controls: - Mouse to aim and shoot by clicking. - \"A\" to reload - \"S\" to use 'engineer powerups', and; - \"D\" to launch a mortar strike (when it's ready). - \"P\" to pause the game - \"M\" to mute. Pro-Tips: - Fire at groups of enemies for better efficiency. - Vehicles explode, time those well so you take out a couple of soldiers as well. - Gun overheated? Reload while you wait! Major thanks to the following guys for beta-testing this game: Deadclever23, liaaaam, Saza, and other people I've forgotten (sorry). Even bigger thanks to Zuggz for decompiling my swf after I lost al my files in a crash. Decompilers are quite useful after all, so are back-ups.

Useful for many things.\nYou must duck to eat things on the ground.\n\nThe game can be played in CHALLENGE or SPEEDRUN mode. It defaults to challenge, which is a collection of 7 levels. Speedruns can be unlocked and chosen in the OPTIONS screen. You need Bones to unlock speedruns (and buy goodies). You get bones by eating critters and reaching milestones.\n\nEarn DNA by collecting eggs and eating critters. Use your DNA to upgrade your dino.\nThe game auto-saves. You have 3 slots open for different dinos.\n\nThe game is DEEP so EXPLORE and have fun!",

      "originalDescription": "*12/30/2005* - updated the game with my new website address... www.totaljerkface.com ... I also increased the frame rate to make up for the lag of playing it in a browser... so now the priest will walk at his intended speed, but the game may be a bit harder.\n\nBEFORE PLAYING: If your computer is old, play this on low quality and cheat. Otherwise, you won't make it past the first guy. If your computer is decent, I'd still recommend medium quality as it looks very similar to high.\n\nHERE ARE SOME PLAYING TIPS:\n-if you can't gun down the little kids with the pistol (takes 3 shots) cheat under the options menu... and pick all guns.\n-the uzi is probably the most defensive weapon since you can aim it in one spot, hold down shoot, and let the guys run into it... but if you're accurate, definitely use the shotgun.\n-walk slow into the level. enemies appear based on how far you walk... if you walk too far too quickly you'll get swarmed\n-for the boss... you can only shoot him when while his shield is down (with the shotgun). if you see him point at you, you better shoot him in the head immediately. shooting him in the body won't kill him. sorry for being misleading.\n(changed 11.27.03)\n\n.... once you get used to it, the game really isn't so hard\n\nI made this game as a portfolio piece so I could more successfully attempt getting a job. I started in january, but that was on and off. I didn't work on it full time until late summer. I thought it would be the first scroller/shooter of it's kind, but madness interactive and nightmare beat me to it, and did it really well. I'd love to show you guys a full 5 level game... but that would be way over 5 megs and would take me another year.\nIf you like this game, and you also happen to be a relevent employer in or around NYC... GIVE ME A JOB. I am poor and lame.\n\nother than that, go watch \"beautiful day\" again with a loved one.\n\n11.22.03 - fixed walking glitch",

We just wanted to clarify that whilst Earn to Die 2012 is promoting the mobile version, is not in fact a demo version, but a separate standalone version with a separate story to the mobile version.\n\nAlthough Earn to Die 2012 doesn’t contain as many levels or vehicles as the mobile version, we believe it is still a big improvement on the original Flash version and we hope that players will still appreciate the hard work we have put into creating Earn to Die 2012.\n\nFor us this is a full time job which is why we haven’t been able to offer the mobile version for free (game developers like everyone else still need to make a living after all). In fact, most of our year was spent dedicated on building up the Earn to Die franchise with both the mobile and Flash version.\n\nWe hope that regardless of which version or on which platform you are playing, that you will continue to enjoy the game and appreciate the long hours which went into building it and improving on the original Earn to Die game.",

And catching bugs that eat the fruit that grows within your bog, They want to steal your fruit away, but it is not for them! So snap them up with your long tongue, before they reach the stem... All the fully ripened fruits are legal currency! Spend them at the store to purchase frog technology. How this ties to fractions is a little bit obscure, but if you don't know fractions then this game may be your cure",

      "originalDescription": "Be the GunMaster! Shoot, dodge, jump, and bomb your way through the never ending invasion! Author Comments: This is version 2.0 of my original GunMaster Game. I was stuck at home sick for a week so decided to make a game where you're a army man commando unit that had to last as long as possible against a never ending invasion of enemy units. Of course the game will get harder the longer you lasted, so death is inevitable. I wanted to test out some new techniques with explosions, blood and damage visualizations. And rather than have upgrades I wanted to have instant gratification so you would start off with all the weapons but you'd have to go pick up ammo crates as they were air dropped to random areas of the map. This would add random challenges and make every experience unique. I love adding random effects, but some people complain that they always run out of normal ammo. I believe it just forces people to learn how to conserve ammo or to become proficient at using the other weapons. Another feature of the game was the cross-hair system for accuracy. I wanted to simulate an FPS shooting system where you are more accurate if you crouched and are less accurate when you are moving. This game has been the result of several consecutive hours of work, and rarely have I been given the opportunity to work on a single project for so many hours in just a single week. I should get sick more often ;) ::please don't try to poison me:: I should also note that all the sounds featured in this game are original creations by me made with a clip on mic using windows sound recorder =) The soundtrack was created by my friend at www.marcustyr.com.

I wanted to reinvent the sort of \"fling stuff as far as you can\" formula to provide more control and an objective/minor storyline. Enjoy! -jmtb02 .-=====================-.

We took a few liberties but overall tried to match the progression pretty closely. Enjoy!!!\n\nAlso note the fun fan-art gallery, showcasing stuff from the Art Portal!\n\nHAPPY MADNESS DAY 2009!\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSept 23 - Final boss bugs should be fixed! Clear your cache.\n\nSept 24 - Hank now spends less time on the ground, while enemies spend more and can be shot while on ground. Hopefully this feels a little better!\n\nSept 29 - Fixed doorway agent bug and added a SWAP button (D) to swap weapons when you already have one. Walking over a weapon you already have will increase your ammo!\n\nSept 30 - Added option for MOUSE AIMING! We hope this makes lots of people happy.\n\nOct 1 - Added Madness Mode, which you unlock by beating the game. It's HARDCORE!\n\nSorry I can't add a pause button. This game is in AS2 and built in a way that simply doesn't allow it. Flash has no native pause support.",

The task is simple...the more shapes you collect, the more points you get. Yellow shapes still multiply your points, but what does the pulsing color shape do? Unlock new shapes, patterns and even the ability to play your own music as you go further and further into the musical world of Music Catch!\nUPDATE: Thank you everyone for all of your great feedback! Here is some more info based on comments thus far.\n*** Once you unlock the \"MP3 from URL\" feature, you can use any public URL that returns an MP3. Since the file has to be public, music on your own computer will not work. Also, HTML pages and YouTube videos will not work because they do not return an MP3 file. Most URL's will actually end in .mp3, but as long as the URL returns the MP3 data, any URL should work. If a valid MP3 file fails the first time, trying again may fix the problem.\n*** For example, to play audio from Newgrounds Audio Portal, you just need to replace the XXXXXX in the following URL with the Newgrounds ID of the song you want: www.newgrounds.com/audio/\ndownload/XXXXXX\n*** The music in the game is by Isaac Shepard and is from his album \"Deep Joy\".\n*** NEW iPhone Version: Music Catch is now available for your iPhone.

Lately we've been working on this project none stop, acknowledging if we release it after the real Portal - we fail, and our test will be terminated ( ;). So yes, the last piece of code of this game was programed just a couple of minutes ago. Don't worry - those minutes were on bugs!\n\nPortal: The Flash Version includes over 40 challenging, portals thinking levels, which features almost every feature the real game does, in 2d - energy balls, cubes, turrets and even the famous crusher from the trailer. The game also includes a console to mess around with after finishing the game, or just being frustrated by thinking with portals (Commands are posted in our forums)\n\nportal.wecreatestuff.com\n\nControls:\nLeft mouse button - launch a portal.\nA W D - movement\nQ - launch a blue portal.\nE - launch a yellow portal.\nR - Close both portals.\nF - pick up an object.\n~ - open up console (enable through the options)\nO - quick quality adjust.\nEsc/P - pause game.\n\nVersion history:\nportal.wecreatestuff.com/\nverhistory.txt\n\nNote:\nThe game really is heavy on levels 30 and up. We did our best to optimize it, but if you still have a low frame rate simply change your quality and effect settings.\n\nIf you find any bugs, please report.",

With the help of his baby brother and dog, Simon is set on defending his rightfully earned treasure. This aim and shoot game is misleadingly easy looking but can be difficult to play. First, select the angle by moving your mouse. Then select the strength by moving your mouse up and down. Your goal is to knock out each of your opponents using tennis balls or other items that you’ve acquired. Every time you take a turn, they’ll make their aim in response. You must get rid of the pirates before they get rid of Simon and his little brother. Once you’ve beaten the first set of pirates, you can move up to each level which will feature other enemies like Vikings! After each level, you can use your cash to purchase upgrades. Upgrades can get you better tools and rafts to help you defend your treasure in this sea warfare game.",

These games are made for YOU, people! UDPATE (NOW LIVE!) Game has been patched according to user suggestions: - Battles now run significantly faster. - Block can only be used twice on your bar, but the cool down has been decreased. - Paladin's Shield now has a much longer cool down. - Rock Golems can no longer use Suppression. Health decreased, life increased. - Melee Shaman's heals now have a larger cool down, and he can no longer regen focus. - All the audio is now in sync with the subtitles. - You can now Re-Spec 5 times a day instead of once. - Veradux's \"Re-Energize\" ability now only applies a buff that restores 10 focus per turn, so when he casts it on a target with full focus, you still get 90% of the benefit.",

Face the challenge of struggling to survive in a world of paper thin citizens, super-human bar-room brawls and cut throat corporate ladders. This life sim is reminiscent of 'Jones in the Fast Lane' - but the lane is so much faster, and the life, so much... Stickier\n\nRight from the get-go, you're beset with a multitude of alternatives; what statistics to concentrate on, where to find employment, and whether to abide by the law or to spit in its face! In StickRPG, you have the power to make choices that affect your stickman's life, and the results, unlike real life, are often hilarious, and often occur... often!",

Although the first game did fairly well, a lot of suggestions were brought and I felt like we could do better. This then, is the result of hundreds of user comments and reviews. I think it's a big step up, and I hope you all enjoy it!\n\nStormWinds places the player in a steampunk setting, facing a massive invasion of airships and other flying contraptions. A blend between a tower defense game and a shooter, you must choose your defenses then use them personally to gain victory.\n\nThis game is by far Hero Interactive's largest to date- over 10 people had a hand in the game at some stage in development.\n\nWe've also upped what is offered to those who purchase the extra content for $5 USD. Players who make the purchase now get access to 2 new campaigns, new weapons, new enemies, a new boss, new challenge missions (as they come out), and cheat codes. In addition, when the beta of Bubble Tanks 2 is released, extra content purchasers will be invited to join in!\n\nA big thank you to everyone who supported the game, gave great feedback, and helped to bring this better version online!\n\nControls\nTutorial is available on the first campaign.\n\nHotkeys can be reconfigured through the settings menu option. Press 'P' to pause. Game automatically saves after each level so you can easily come back later.",

      "originalDescription": "Updated November 26th 2012:\nThe level designer has a few new additions, and is using the new portal. Check it out!\n\nUpdated July 23th 2009: Added a mode in the level designer that lets you play other people's levels vote on them. Also fixed a few glitches.\n\nUpdated June 27th 2009: Fixed a few glitches (such as the slide in the basement, etc.) and added in w more Level Designer Items, such as Level Transitions, Orange Block Switches, etc.\n\nSuper Mario 63 is a fan-game inspired by Nintendo's Super Mario 64. Many levels and features are based upon it and other of Nintendo's games, but a variety of them are completely original. Among them include a detailed storyline, ability to play as Luigi, a highly customizable Level Designer with sharable codes, three different FLUDD Power-ups, four different power-caps, and 64 Shine Sprites & 64 Star Coins to collect.\n\nThis is the final, complete version of this game. If you have seen this game anywhere else (except on SheezyArt) it probably was taken without permission AND it was the demo version. Only 2 websites have this version of the game.\n\nAlso, this game is, for the most part, a remake of the Super Mario Sunshine 64 I made in 2006. After we released the game and came back a few years later, we decided to redo the game with a better engine, more objectives, ect. and this is the product... I kind of went a little overboard, but whatever.\n\nIf, while playing, you hear random static noise, we apologize; it is a result of too many sounds being overlapped in flash player therefore overloading some of the less-than-perfect sound cards...\n\nAnd also, please use the Level Designer. I personally feel that the Level Designer is the best feature.\n\nControls are explained in game, but we will summarize them here:\nArrow keys: Move around/ jump/ dive\nZ : Talk/Ground Pound\nX: Spin Attack\nC: Use Fludd\nShift: Switch Fludds\nP: Pause Game\n- Zoom Out\n+ Zoom In\n\nIf you are having trouble with the Z key, try pressing ALT + SHIFT to switch to the American layout.\n\nCredits are in-game.\n\nLast updated: June 27, 2009",

Blade and Blue sprites are modified versions of Equinox_Twilight's Flare the Hedgehog and others, they were made by a fan\n\n**This game saves automatically so feel no need to beat it all at once! And thanks a lot Tom for letting me upload! and FRONTPAGE TOO?! Wow!**\nFAQ and Strategy Guide: http://tinyurl.com/s7u6c\n\nI finally release my first game, Super Smash Flash! Play as 28 different characters in Multi-man Melee, Target Test, Adventure, Classic, All-Star and more! So have fun! (I recommend a decent computer to run this game.)\n\nOther Info:\n\n-topcat13 is the one who created the characters Blade and Blue.\n-Do not yell at me for not putting in EVERY single character from SSBM, I have my reasons.\n-If you don't like the gameplay, at least cut me some slack since I'm only 16 and it's my first real game.\n-You can't play team battles without at least one member on 2 or more of the teams.\n-Player 1 is required for V.S. Battles\n-I find it quite entertaining to watch CPU's battle it out to see who's best, try it!\n-All Credit Info is already in the SWF",

It's been 7 years since we released Superfighters here on Newgrounds. Just wanted to let you know that the sequel, Superfighters Deluxe, is releasing on Steam TODAY! To everyone who's played over the years, cheers! Visit SuperfightersDeluxe.com for more info.\nUpdate 2012-06-16: A sequel, Superfighters Deluxe, is in development. You can partake in pre-alpha testing by visiting MythoLogicInteractive.com.\nUpdate 2011-07-28: SURVIVAL MODE added! Make your stand (solo or co-op) against endlessly spawning enemies.\nUpdate 2011-07-23: Improved visibility of players and weapons. AI difficulty has been tweaked slightly and in Stage Mode we removed the \"best of 3\" condition - you now only need to win the stage once to advance to the next. When the new version comes online, a version number should show in the upper left corner.\n---\nSuperfighters is all about little men shooting, stabbing, mashing, smashing, burning and blowing each other into tiny bits... and then doing it all over again!\nThe first thing you need to know about SF is this: IT AIN'T FAIR. It's not supposed to be fair. Player spawns are random. Weapon spawns are random. The objects that spawn on the map are random. Critical hits with guns are random. It's not about balanced competetive gameplay, it's about chaos. Complete and utter chaos. We ask that you keep that in mind and don't get angry if you have a bad first experience - the tables will turn. Thank you :)\n* 1 and 2 player mode. Play co-op with a friend or try your best to murder him.\n* 13 weapons and 4 maps.\n* The spectacle is made more spectacular with Box2D physics.\n* Pick up bullet time powerups for a boost in combat.\n* Finish the Stage Mode to unlock a new player skin!\nSpecial thanks to hzlancer and Chriss!\nEnjoy!",

If you can avoid doing this, you will find that there are a lot less random deaths. To see what I am talking about, go into the tutorial and keep holding up and right.\n-Never press K while standing next to a wall four or more blocks high that is composed of two or more pieces. You will almost certainly die.\n-Ninja is by far the hardest medal in this game. Contrary to popular belief, it is not impossible.\n-If you are falling off the side, try using either J or K to save yourself. It can really help out.\n-If you are about to get crushed, sometimes J will glitch the character to jump up through the block and K will glitch the character to roll through the block.\n-True G4m3rs know how to use exploits to their advantage.\n-------------------\nAfter receiving an overwhelming number of requests, I present to you the TETRIS'D game! I teamed up with programmer Cam McKinnon (LittleMonsterGames) in order to bring this game to life. We also kept Parker's fantastic music!\nAvoid the deadly tetrominoes and stay alive as long as you possibly can. The game goes on for as long as you can stay alive. Try and get the highest score possible.\nCONTROLS:\nWalk: Left/Right (or A/D)\nJump: Up (or W)\nGrab+Roll: K (you grab onto a block next to you, and flip onto it)\nWall Jump: J\nOn a side note, I would like to thank all of my fans. You guys are the force that keeps me coming back to Newgrounds. I would also like to thank the game's sponsor, StickPage.com.\nGood luck everyone, and enjoy!\nKobra Editing",

Of course, as the game goes on things get tougher and you will soon start running out of space. Luckily there are powerups which appear every so often to help you out. That's about it really - it's quite a simple, elegant game (we think), and we really enjoyed making it. If you can achieve over 150,000 points then you're doing very well. Thanks for reading and leave us some feedback if you have time. :-)\n\nCheers,\n\nThe Megadev team.",

Guillaume was really excited about \"Lucidity\" and the idea of playing a \"Tetris platform\" game... but he finally felt disapointed by the concept.\n\n\n\nSo, Guillaume decided to create a little Tetris plateformer for fun.\nWilliam came with the idea to mix up Tetris with another well know game: Super Mario Bros.\n\n\n\nAnd here it is: Tuper Tario Tros.! (what an amazing title)\n\n\n\nThis experiment is the first one in a series that we will try to bring to you, sailors :)\nDon't hesitate to give us your feedbacks.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nCONTROLS\n\n\n\n- Arrows to move\n- X to jump\n- Space to switch between games\n- C to speed up the scrolling\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nUPDATES\n\n\n\n06/01/10 - v 1.2\n- How to play section added to main menu\n- We added some control keys to fit with everybody's brain\n- You can now speed up the scrolling, you tetris' lamers !\n- You have now 120 seconds to finish the boss battle.

It's pretty challenging.\nIf it's your first time playing, go through the in-game tutorial.\nPlease vote and review fairly and constructively, and recommend for action collection!\nEDIT-- I fixed the enter glitch, no more cheating :D;\nEDIT II -- I have to get this off my chest... This is not a Shift rip-off. so stop comparing it to Shift. There are a few reasons.\n1) This game isn't even in the same genre. This is action platformer. There is no puzzle. \n2) While the graphics are quite similar, this game's graphics were modeled after Hunted Forever more than Shift.\n3) The concept was invented of my own creativity. The gameplay is more reflective of the unfair platformer than any other game out there. There is no Shift concept here.\n4) There is no invisibility is Shift. You can only be killed by what you can see.\nTo be fair, I'll list the similarities.\n1) The graphics are somewhat similar. Black character and black ground. Yay.\n2) The goal is the same- get to the end of the level without dying... the same as every other platformer out there.\ni'm not saying that Shift was not a good game. Shift is a much better game than mine (for now). I'm just saying that my game is only similar in insignificant ways. now That I've got that off my chest, I'll leave you to play [Visible].",

A big thanks to everyone who helped me test, and Tom and NG for the sponsorship!\n\nAs always, leave a comment! I love reading them.\n\nEDIT: The game has version detection, but YOU NEED FLASH 10 to play it. If you have trouble loading the game, please send me a PM with the details.\n\nEDIT: Because nearly everyone is saying they can't figure out the boss's pattern, I've made a slight change that should make it more obvious.

You can support us and add it to your wishlist! <3 https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240210/ ------------ ! Doesn't work properly on Internet Explorer, Edge and Safari ! ! If you have a black screen, try to switch off Adblock or to accept the plugin permission from your browser ! ----- WINNER of the DeceptionJam. There is no game. There is nothing to do. Do not click or tap anywhere. Really. DO NOT CLICK OR TAP ANYWHERE. Do not laugh as there is nothing to laugh about. Don't try to use your computer mouse. Don't try to touch your mobile screen. It's at your own risk!! This game has not been reviewed on Youtube by the not game narrator himself! http://bit.ly/1CumoZ6 *Sorry for my weird foreign accent* :) *I'm french, not russian!*\n\n ---Cool Math Games---\nInstructions How can there be instructions when there is no game? But try using your mouse anyway. We also highly recommend that you don't play this game with sound on. You will not get hints from the narrator that will end up helping you progress further. If you ever get stuck, make sure not to search for anything out of the ordinary such as letters that look slightly askew. This will do nothing to help you progress through the game. What is the story of There Is No Game? The idea behind There Is No Game is that there is an unreliable narrator who is trying to trick you. Despite him telling you over and over that the game does not exist and that progression is impossible, there is in fact a game. We don’t want to spoil too much, so you’ll just have to find it out for yourself. How do you play There Is No Game? Starting There Is No Game can be a confusing yet fun challenge. If you do not want the mystery ruined for you, do not read on… The first step in your progression through the game is to click on the ‘O’ in the title of There Is No Game. If you click it roughly 10 times, it will shake loose and you will start progressing through the game. An important part of playing There Is No Game is to keep your volume on. While oftentimes the narrator is lying, he will occasionally give you clues on what to do next. It is almost impossible to get through without the narrator, so plug in some headphones and get playing! How many endings are there in There Is No Game? Once you make it to the end, there are two alternate endings in There Is No Game. Players can either decide to forgive the Game, or not to forgive the Game. The choice is yours, if you can figure out how make it there. For tips on getting to the end, you can check out our Coolmath Games blog on how (not) to play There Is No Game.",
